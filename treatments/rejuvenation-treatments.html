      <p>Skin Boosters are micro-injections of very smooth dermal filler that
      contains hyaluronic acid. The hyaluronic acid is soft and absorbs water
      and brings deep skin hydration to the treated areas, giving it improved
      firmness, elasticity, and smoothness. Pores and scars become more refined
      and skin tone improves significantly. Typically, Skin Booster lasts for
      about six
      months.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Radiant and
      hydrated skin</li><li>Improves elasticity</li><li>Reduces acne
