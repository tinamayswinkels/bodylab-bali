      <p>Radio frequency technology that we use in Bodylab helps to revitalize
      and rejuvenate your skin. Electro-magnetic waves penetrates the
      skin&rsquo;s layers to selectively heat the tissue and extra cellular
      matrix where the collagen fibers are embedded. The local heating
      stimulates the collagen fibers and fibroblast cells to produce new
      collagen and elastic fibers resulting in lifted
      skin.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Contours and tightens
      body shape</li><li>Reduces cellulite</li><li>Reduces

    subtitle: Shrink Pores and Fine Lines
    description_html: >-
      <p>Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) facial peels can help you achieve a fresher,
      more luminous complexion. As old skin cells shed, new cells grow but when
      the old cells remain, your skin can look dull and lifeless. A weekly AHA
      peel will improve your skin texture immediately. The procedure is fast and
      convenient, taking only about fifteen minutes, with virtually no recovery
      time.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Refines skin
      texture</li><li>Smooths fine lines</li><li>Reduces the appearance of acne
      scars&nbsp;</li><li>Reduced pigmentation&nbsp;</li></ul>

      <p>Vacuum roller massage is an effective method to battle cellulite and
      remove fat deposits from your body and resulting in weight loss. Using a
      mechanical roll device we can dislodge fat pockets trapped in subcutaneous
      tissue, while stimulating the blood and lymphatic flow and improving the
      appearance and elasticity of the
      skin.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduces and prevents

  - title: 3D Slimming
    title-highlighted: Skin
    subtitle: facial
    description_html: >-
      <p>Ultrasound cavitation is high-frequency sound waves that disrupt the
      fat cell walls and consequently the fat cells &ldquo;leak&rdquo; their
      contents into the fluid spaces of your body. From there, your lymphatic
      system picks up this waste material (the loose fat) and begins circulating
      it through your body until it can be processed by liver and eliminated
      with sweat, urine and feces. The results are visibly noticeable
      immediately, but full elimination of the toxins takes about 7 days.
      That&rsquo;s why we advise to do this treatment once a week. The 3D
      slimming machine uses unique ultrasound cavitation technology combined
      with vacuum roller infrared function which brings all the fat cells broken
      earlier into the lymphatic system and smoothes the
      skin.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Volume reduction of
      tissues (fat blasting)</li><li>Body shaping and contouring</li><li>Skin
      tightening and toning</li><li>Cellulite
      reduction</li></ul><p><strong>LONG-LASTING
      RESULTS</strong></p><ul><li>Complex slimming solution</li><li>Stimulates
