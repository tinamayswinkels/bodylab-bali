      peel to your weekly beauty routine. You will notice a difference in your
      skin texture immediately. The procedure is fast and convenient, taking

  - title: 3D Slimming
    title-highlighted: Skin
    subtitle: facial
    description_html: >-
      <p>Ultrasound cavitation is high-frequency sound waves that disrupt the
      fat cell walls and consequently the fat cells &ldquo;leak&rdquo; their
      contents into the fluid spaces of your body. From there, your lymphatic
      system picks up this waste material (the loose fat) and begins circulating
      it through your body until it can be processed by liver and eliminated
      with sweat, urine and feces. The results are visibly noticeable
      immediately, but full elimination of the toxins takes about 7 days.
      That&rsquo;s why we advise to do this treatment once a week. The 3D
      slimming machine uses unique ultrasound cavitation technology combined
      with vacuum roller infrared function which brings all the fat cells broken
      earlier into the lymphatic system and smoothes the
      skin.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Volume reduction of
      tissues (fat blasting)</li><li>Body shaping and contouring</li><li>Skin
