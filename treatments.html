      The procedures use rounded paddles in one of four sizes to suction your
      skin and fat &ldquo;like a vacuum,&rdquo; fat cells that are frozen during
      the fat freezing treatment gradually die off and leave the body through
      the body&rsquo;s natural elimination process. That&rsquo;s why the results
      are long-term. One procedure can reduce 30% of volume treated area. Fat

      until it can be processed by liver and flushed from your body. The results

      takes about seven days. We advise to do this treatment once a
