    title-highlighted: Hollywood Carbon Peeling
    subtitle: 'Deep pores cleaning,brightening,'
    description_html: >-
      <p>The Carbon Laser Peel is highly beneficial for people with oily skin,
      blackheads, enlarged pores, dull skin and acne on the face or body. It is
      also an excellent way to exfoliate and refresh your skin, providing an
      instant glow and leaving skin feeling softer, smoother and firmer with
      fine lines &amp; wrinkles reduced.</p><p>It works by applying a layer of
      liquid carbon to the skin, where it penetrates deep into the pores. Laser
      light is highly attracted to the carbon particles. When the laser is
      passed over the area, it destroys the carbon, taking dead skin cells,
      contaminants and oil with it.</p><p>The facial has been dubbed the
      &ldquo;Hollywood Peel&rdquo; because there are several A-list fans of the
      treatment &ndash; including Angelina Jolie and Kim Kardashian. It&rsquo;s
      success is down to it&rsquo;s immediate positive effects without any
      down-time or discomfort and as a result it&rsquo;s now being used by many
      celebs just before a red carpet event. It&rsquo;s so effective at
      combatting active acne that just 4 treatments is enough to clear even the
      most stubborn spots.</p><p><strong>PERFECT FOR</strong>:</p><p>▪ Active
      acne &nbsp; &nbsp;▪ Acne scars</p><p>▪ Large pores &nbsp; &nbsp;▪ Melasma

    title-highlighted: Q Switched ClearLift laser
    subtitle: 'Brightening,rejuvenation,lifting'
    description_html: >-
      <p>Q Switched ClearLift Laser&nbsp; is an innovative treatment that takes
      years off of your face in just minutes, often referred to as the
      &lsquo;Lunchtime Facelift&rsquo; the treatment is highly controlled with
      no pain and no downtime, but still providing similar results to chemical
      peeling and laser resurfacing. The laser heats deep beneath the skin (up
      to 3mm in depth), so all the skin healing happens underneath the
      epidermis, without damaging the upper layers of the epidermis at
      all.</p><p>It is becoming an increasingly popular facial rejuvenation
      treatment, people love the results of the ClearLift seeing benefits with
      skin tightening, reduction of pigment and fine lines. The laser uses a
      1064nm pixel Q-Switched laser to create tiny ablative or treatment areas.
      Within these tiny areas, localised &lsquo;damage&rsquo; has occurred,
      which stimulates a healing response. As these areas heal, it causes the
      stimulation of new healthy tissue to grow, as well as enhancing the
      production of collagen and other elastin fibres. This helps skin to
      regenerate and creates a more youthful appearance, improves skin texture
      and tone, reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and helps
      with pigmentation removal.</p><p>Q switched clearlift laser we recommended
      to do once a 3 weeks and for best result repeat 3-4
      times.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><p>&bull; Helps in the
      reduction of fine lines and wrinkles,shinks the pores.</p><p>&bull;
      Brightening skin, reduction of melasma and other pigment
      lesions.</p><p>&bull; Helps to lift and tighten the skin.</p><p>&bull;

  - title: Fat Freezing
    title-highlighted: non-surgical fat removal
    subtitle:
    description_html: >-
      <p>Fat freezing is a non-invasive alternative to liposuction. Through the
      controlled application of cooling within the temperature range of +5 to
      -11 &deg;C, the procedure reduces fat cell volume by up to 30%</p><p>By
      the end of the freezing treatment, the targeted fat cells gradually die
      off and are expelled through the body&rsquo;s natural elimination process.
      For this reason, the end result can be seen up to three months later. Fat
      Freezing sessions can be done only once per month. This treatment is
      recommended in conjunction with
      Pressotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduction

    title-highlighted: 3D Slimming
    subtitle: target problem areas
    description_html: >-
      <p>3D Slimming uses unique ultrasound cavitation technology, combined with
      vacuum roller infrared function, to break down fat and smooth the skin.
      Once the fat cells are broken down, your lymphatic system picks up this
      waste material (the loose fat) and essentially flushes it from your body.
      The results are visible immediately after treatment but full elimination
      of broken fat cells can take up to seven days. This treatment is best done
      once a week in conjunction with
      Pressotherapy.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Fat

      <p>Laser hair removal will give you smoother skin and permanent hair

      Treatment can work on any body part you wish to remove hair from, and is
      especially effective on the bikini, lip, chin, and underarm area. For
      permanent hair reduction you need to complete 7-10 sessions spaced 6-8
      weeks apart.&nbsp;</p><p>We ask that you shave the area you are treating
      beforehand so that the laser can penetrate deep into the root of the
      hair.&nbsp;</p><p>You should not wax, tweeze, or bleach any hair one month
      before your session because the root needs to stay in tact in order for
      the laser to be effective.</p><p>Duration: 15-120 min depending on area of
