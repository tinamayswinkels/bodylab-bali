    <h2>Botox Treatments in Bali</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;Look younger for longer</p>
    <p>Botox is one of our most popular treatments at Body Lab Bali.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We use only the highest quality Allergan Botox from USA and all injectables are administered by an experienced medical professional.</p>
    <p>Effects last about three to eight months, depending on what concern you are addressing.</p>

    <h3>How does Botox work?</h3>
    <p>Over the years, your face will naturally develop expression lines and wrinkles from daily repeated facial movements such as smiling, squinting, frowning, etc. Our medical professional will inject Botox to temporarily reduce the muscle activity in your forehead, crows' feet, in between your eyebrows and any other area of concern. This will smooth out any existent fine lines and wrinkles and will prevent new ones from forming.</p>

  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>Is your medical professional qualified?</h3>
    <p>.Yes!, at Body Lab Bali all our treatments are delivered by highly experienced and fully certified professionals.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Doctor Hesty Hutabarat is a dermatologist&nbsp; with 8 years of experience and the results from our clients speak by themselves.</p>

    <h3>What type of results should I expect?</h3>
    <p>You will start seeing results within the first week after your treatment. The final results will be visible after 10 days.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You can expect to look like yourself, but younger and with less noticeable expression lines.</p>

  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>Are there any precautions to consider after a Botox treatment?</h3>
    <p>We recommend you to avoid laying down for 3-4 hours following your treatment and to skip any physical exercise or activity that may induce profuse sweating for at least 24 hours.</p>
    <p>We suggest you plan your day around your Botox treatment and consider that there is a small risk of bruising or swelling in the injection area. this is a normal temporary reaction that disappears within 24 hours.</p>
