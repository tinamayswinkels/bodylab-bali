    <h3>How muscle toning treatment works?</h3>
    <p>At Body Lab Bali we use the latest technology with the machine "Vip Lipo Line Duo"&nbsp; which transmits electric impulses to the nerve nodes and muscle fibers, toning your muscles and contracting them in intense, short movements.</p>
    <p>This unique way to workout your muscles, takes energy from the fat cells, therefore burning more calories, toning and slimming your body at the same time.</p>
    <p>This type of muscle stimulation is called &ldquo;isometric contraction&rdquo;, which manages to target specific muscle groups so you can get the best results.</p>

    <h3>How many sessions do I need before I see results?</h3>
    <p>You will notice a difference from the very first session! Your skin will be firmer, smoother and will have a youthful glow.</p>
    <p>We recommend you to have 6-12 sessions, 2-3 times per week in order to obtain fantastic and sustainable results.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>Are the results permanent?</h3>
    <p>With all non-invasive, non-surgical treatments, how long the results last for will greatly&nbsp; depend on your lifestyle choices.</p>
    <p>Our suggestions are: exercise regularly, drink plenty of water and maintain a healthy diet, free of processed sugars and empty calories.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We strongly recommend for you to have a &ldquo;top up&rdquo; session every month or so, to help keep your muscles toned and firm.</p>
