    <h3>How many sessions do I need to see results??</h3>
    <p>You will see an immediate improvement in your skin appearance with most of our treatments, and you will see visible, more dramatic results after 4-8 sessions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Generally, with all Face Lifting and Contouring face treatments&nbsp; 20% - 40% of the results can be seen immediately after the first treatment, and&nbsp; 3-6 months later the final result is visible.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>Are the results permanent?</h3>
    <p>Most of our treatments will give you incredible results that will last 3-9 months, depending on your lifestyle and skin care routine.</p>
    <p>We strongly recommend to support the treatment results by following a healthy diet, avoiding smoking, alcohol or sun exposure and drinking plenty of water on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>For all our treatments that are non-surgical and non-invasive, we suggest for you to have 1-2 sessions every couple of months to maintain the results.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>How many sessions do I need and how often?</h3>
    <p>To see the best results, you want to commit to 5-10 sessions, ideally twice a week to allow for your skin to produce collagen and recover from the muscle stimulation.</p>
  </div>

      <h3>Does Double Chin Fat Freezing give you permanent results?</h3>
      <p>Yes, Fat Freezing is the only non-surgical and non-invasive technology available that removes localised excess fat permanently.</p>
      <p>You will need 1-4 sessions to obtain the best results.</p>

    <h3>What is the best treatment to reduce excess facial fat and improve muscle tone at the same time?</h3>
    <p>Transion Facial Contouring is your best option if you're looking to define and lift your facial features, reduce fat pockets on the chin, cheeks or jaw line, is your best option!</p>
    <p>Transion treatment consists on gentle electrical stimulation which enhances the muscle tone and the blood circulation in the targeted areas. The muscular activity leads to a rapid strengthening of the facial muscles, providing a noticeable lift of sagging areas, which once improved, will give you a renewed youthful look.</p>
