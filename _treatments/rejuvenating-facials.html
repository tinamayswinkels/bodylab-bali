    <h3>What is PRP Facial and how does it work?</h3>
    <p>The vampire facial, also known as the Platelet-Rich Plasma(PRP facial), includes drawing blood from your arm, separating the platelets, and then injecting them into your skin via microneedling and injections .</p>
    <p>The doctor runs the needle pen over your face while squirting the platelets into the mini injection holes.</p>
    <p>Since the platelets are high in growth hormone, and the microneedling stimulates the skin to regenerate, the entire procedure is meant to aid cell turnover.</p>
