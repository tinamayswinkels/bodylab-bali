    <p>Helping you look younger for longer is part of our mission. At Body Lab Bali we continuously research and import from around the world the latest aesthetic technology available.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We are proud to offer Liftera and Endymed therapy, two of the most cutting-edge treatments available to tighten, tone and lift your skin.</p>

    <h3>What are the most effective skin tightening treatments at Body Lab Bali?</h3>
    <p>At Body Lab Bali we work exclusively with the latest, most efficient technology:</p>
    <p>-Endymed Radiofrequency, which heats the dermis, boosting collagen production and&nbsp; elastin synthesis, improving oxygen levels in the skin which results in softer fine lines, lifted, firmer skin on your face, and tighter, more radiant skin in your body, after only one treatment.</p>
    <p>-High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HiFU) such as Liftera, to encourage the production of collagen, which results in visibly tighter, firmer skin with fewer wrinkles. HiFU is also fantastic to lift cheeks, eyebrows and eyelids, tighten d&eacute;colletage and sagging skin on the neck and enhance the jawline definition.</p>

  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>How many treatments do I need and what should I expect during a session?</h3>
    <p>-With Endymed, you will see results from the first session and we suggest having 4-8 treatments, once per week.</p>
    <p>This treatment is fantastic as there is no downtime or pain involved during your sessions and results last for up to 12 months. We suggest you book a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; session every 2 months.</p>
    <p>-With Liftera HiFU you can experience some mild pain as we work on SMAS level (3 - 4.5 mm below the skin surface, where the facial muscles are connected to the upper layer of the skin, which is also the layer that plastic surgeons manually pulls during a face lift).</p>
    <p>Treatment can be done once every 30-90 days for up to 3-4 times. And the fabulous results can last for up to 2 years.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>What can be considered as one treated area?</h3>
    <p>One area can be considered as full face, lower face, middle face, upper face, etc for Liftera HiFU treatments.</p>
    <p>For Endymed and Thermolift we work only with your full face.</p>
    <p>For body treatments, one area is considered as: front thighs, back thighs, butt, tummy, etc.</p>
