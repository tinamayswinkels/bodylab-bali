  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>Cleansing facials:</h3>
    <p>These are designed to deeply clean oil and debris from your skin.</p>
    <p>Expect to have your face steamed to open up the pores and facilitate the extraction of whiteheads and blackheads and finish the treatment with a mask or serum to improve and nourish your skin.&nbsp; This facial is ideal for people with large pores, acne or oily/combination type of skin.</p>
    <p>At Body Lab Bali we have the following Cleansing Facials:</p>
    <p>Oxygen Detox Facial, Combination Facial, Hollywood Carbon Facial and HydraFacial MD</p>

    <h3>Rejuvenating &amp; Skin Glowing facials:</h3>
    <p>Specially designed to treat, reduce and prevent the signs of ageing by improving the elasticity and health of your skin. Our aesthetician will deeply cleanse your skin, unclog pores, and depending on your choice of treatment, proceed to utilise different techniques, such as oxygen, laser, microcurrents, etc, to stimulate collagen production, deeply hydrate the skin, and remove sunspots, scars and pigmentation. Our Cleansing Facials will give you fresh, brighter skin and will prevent or reduce fine lines, creases, sagginess and wrinkles.</p>
    <p>At Body Lab Bali we have the following Rejuvenating &amp; Skin Glowing Facials: Oxygeneo, Hydra Facial, Hydra Facial MD, Q switched Clear Lift Laser, Microcurrents Microgei, and Laser Hyperpigmentation removal.</p>

    <h3>Lifting &amp; Firming Facials</h3>
    <p>At Body Lab Bali we use 2 types of technologies:</p>
    <p>-RadioFrequency (RF) such as Thermolift Alma and Endymed, to heat the dermis, boosting collagen production and&nbsp; elastin synthesis, improving oxygen levels in the skin which results in softer fine lines, lifted cheeks and tighter jawlines. Expect firmer, more radiant skin and a youthful look after one treatment.</p>
    <p>-High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HiFU) such as Liftera, to encourage the production of collagen, which results in visibly tighter, firmer skin with fewer wrinkles. HiFU is also fantastic to lift cheeks, eyebrows and eyelids, tighten decolletage and sagging skin on the neck and enhance the jawline definition.</p>

      <h3>What&rsquo;s the best facial if I have a special event in the next few days? (wedding, special date, etc)</h3>
      <p>Your best options to obtain radiant, fresh skin with a fantastic youthful look are:&nbsp;</p>
      <p>-HydraFacialMD</p>
      <p>-Oxygeneo</p>
      <p>-Endymed</p>
      <p>-Thermolift</p>
      <p>-Microcurrents Microgey</p>
      <p>These Facials have absolute no downtime or secondary effects (such as post facial breakouts or redness) and the fabulous results are immediately visible!</p>
    </div>
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>How often should I get a professional Facial?</h3>
    <p>For Cleansing Facials we recommend 1 or 2 treatments per month to clean your skin and maintain it healthy and acne free.</p>
    <p>For Rejuvenating and Skin Glowing Facials we recommend one session about every three to four weeks, as your skin cell turnover cycle is 28 days long. Having one treatment every three to four weeks will help you maintain that beautiful glow and youthful radiance all month long.</p>
    <p>For Lifting &amp; Firming Facials we recommend one treatment every 2-4 months depending on your unique needs. Our in house experts will be happy to assist you find the best treatment and frequency for you</p>
