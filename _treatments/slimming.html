    <h3>How do I choose the right slimming treatment?</h3>
    <p>Our expert aestheticians will help you choose the best treatment for you, depending on how much body fat you want to lose:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>-Fat Freezing is the best choice for localised fat pockets that can be suctioned by the fat freezing cup.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>- Express Super Slimming helps you reduce 2-5 cm on the waist per treatment and at the same time tone up your muscles. You can get fantastic and permanent results after 4-7 sessions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>-Linfogei treatments are recommended when you have impaired lymph outflow, extra body fat and water retention from low activity and wrong diet</p>
    <p>-Pressotherapy detox body wrap is ideal to reduce cellulite and localized fat pockets. When combined with Vacuum Roller or Velashape, these treaments are fantastic to improve lymphatic drainage, skin firmness and lose extra body fat.</p>

    <h3>How many sessions do I need to see results?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With all our treatments you will see visible improvement from the very first sessions, and normally&nbsp; you will need 5-12 sessions spread over 2-6 weeks to see the best, final results.</p>
    <p>Fat Freezing is the only treatment we have at Body Lab Bali that requires one session to obtain dramatic results, specially if you stick to a healthy lifestyle of exercise 3-4 times per week, low carb/low sugar diet and drink 2lts. of water per day.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that the final results will be seen 4-8 weeks after the date of the treatment, as that's how long it takes for your body to get rid of the fat cells that were "frozen and destroyed" during the treatment.&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>Are the results permanent?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All non-invasive slimming treatments at Body Lab Bali can give you fantastic, long lasting results.</p>
    <p>If you want to maintain these results we recommend for you to:</p>
    <p>-Book a "top up" session every 4-6 weeks.</p>
    <p>-Maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly, along with keeping a supportive lifestyle, which includes drinking 2lts of good quality water every day, and minimising alcohol and empty calories consumption.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>What's the most effective slimming treatment if I am able to make just one visit to Body Lab?</h3>
    <p>Fat Freezing is your best choice if you are holidaying in Bali and have time for only one treatment.</p>
    <p>Fat Freezing helps you lose 20-30% of the fat cells in the treated area with only one treatment, and you can maintain these results by drinking 2lts of water per day, and following a low carb diet along with daily exercise.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that the final results will be seen 4-8 weeks after the date of the treatment, as that's how long it takes for your body to get rid of the fat cells that were "frozen and destroyed" during the treatment.&nbsp;</p>
