    <h3>What is Lymphatic Drainage?</h3>
    <p>The main task of the lymph system in our bodies is to drain the waste products and extra water in the body. Over time and due to lifestyle choices, our lymphatic system can get slow and the body starts retaining water and toxins.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Lymphatic Drainage therapy uses light pressure to help the lymphatic system drain fluids, debris, and toxins and also helps in increasing the metabolic rate, all of which support weight loss, cellulite reduction, water retention and prevention of all these issues in the long term.</p>

    <h3>Does it really work and are the results permanent?</h3>
    <p>Lymphatic Drainage is fantastic to reduce cellulite, eliminate fluid retention in the body and support weight loss treatment.</p>
    <p>The technology we use at Body Lab Bali works wonderfully when combined with our other signature treatments such as Fat Freezing, Velashape, Isogei or Express Super Slim as it supports the body to get rid of all the fat cells that were &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; during your treatment.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>How many sessions do I need to see results?</h3>
    <p>Lymphatic Drainage is a type of therapy that will give you instant reduction of inches/cms in your body, so it&rsquo;s ideal before a special event!</p>
    <p>In order to have sustainable results, you need to commit to ideally 4-10 sessions, once per week.</p>
