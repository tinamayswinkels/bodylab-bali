    <h3>What is Lymphatic Drainage?</h3>
    <p>The main task of the lymph system in our bodies is to drain the waste products and extra water in the body. Over time and due to lifestyle choices, our lymphatic system can get slow and the body starts retaining water and toxins.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Lymphatic Drainage therapy uses light pressure to help the lymphatic system drain fluids, debris, and toxins and also helps in increasing the metabolic rate, all of which support weight loss, cellulite reduction, water retention and prevention of all these issues in the long term.</p>
