    <h3>What are the most effective cellulite treatment at Body Lab Bali?</h3>
    <p>Vacuum roller massage: using a mechanical roller to dislodge fat pockets, this treatment also stimulates lymphatic flow and improves your skin's elasticity. Ideal for cellulite on stages 1-2 that is widely spread over thighs and buttocks.</p>
    <p>Velashape: a powerful combination of vacuum, infrared light and bipolar high focused radiofrequency (RF) that is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of cellulite and tighten loose skin. Ideal for cellulite 1-2 stage.</p>
    <p>Super cellulite reduction: effectively combines fat cavitation and vacuum roller massage. Ideal for hard cellulite on stages 2-4 that is accompanied by thick fat tissue.</p>

    <h3>What are the different stages of cellulite?</h3>
    <p>CELLULITE STAGE 1: When pinched gently between the forefinger and thumb, the skin shows a slight &lsquo;orange-peel&rsquo; effect&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>CELLULITE STAGE 2: The skin feels thicker and slightly tender if pinched gently between the forefingers and thumb. You can definitely see an orange-peel effect.</p>
    <p>CELLULITE STAGE 3: Without pinching, you can observe an orange-peel effect. Fluid retention is permanently present and it can cause discomfort in everyday life.</p>
    <p>CELLULITE STAGE 4: Without pinching, you can observe a "mattress surface" effect: the skin is visibly puckered in, creating visible irregularities in its surface.</p>

  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>What type of results should I expect?</h3>
    <p>If you have followed your cellulite reduction program and have supported the treatments by drinking at least 2lts of water per day, eating a low carb diet and exercising regularly, you should see a progressive visible reduction on the appearance of cellulite in the areas that are being treated.</p>
    <p>At the end of your cellulite program, you should have achieved the goals discussed with your aesthetician on your first consultation.&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-2 editable">
    <h3>What do you recommend to ensure I obtain fast and permanent results in cellulite reduction?</h3>
    <p>-Eliminate or minimise the consumption of processed sugar, caffeine and alcohol and focusing on a diet that is abundant in fresh produce and healthy fats</p>
    <p>-Exercise at least 3 times per week</p>
    <p>-Drink 2-3 lts of water every day</p>
    <p>-Dry brush every morning before shower and apply a high quality moisturiser. We have fantastic products that you can take home with you to support your cellulite treatments!</p>

      <h3>How many treatments I need to complete to get the best results?</h3>
      <p>On your first consultation, our expert aesthetician will hear your concerns and assess the condition of the area to be treated.</p>
      <p>After this assessment she will recommend you the best cellulite reduction program for you. Often we will suggest for you to combine treatments as when there is cellulite present, in most cases there is extra body fat in the form of pockets, fluid retention due to poor circulation, and saggy skin.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In most cases you will need 8-12 sessions to obtain visible results</p>
