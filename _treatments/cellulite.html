    <h3>What type of results should I expect?</h3>
    <p>If you have followed your cellulite reduction program and have supported the treatments by drinking at least 2lt water per day, eating a low carb diet and exercising regularly, you should see a progressive visible reduction on the appearance of cellulite in the areas that are being treated. At the end of your cellulite program, you should have achieved the goals discussed with your aesthetician on your first consultation.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>How many treatments I need to complete to get the best results?</h3>
      <p>On your first consultation, our expert aesthetician will recommend you the best cellulite reduction program for you. Often we will suggest for you to combine treatments as when there is cellulite present, in most cases there is extra body fat in the form of pockets, fluid retention due to poor circulation, and saggy skin.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In most cases you will need 8-12 sessions to obtain visible results</p>
