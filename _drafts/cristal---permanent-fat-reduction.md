Body Lab now offers fat reduction with a new machine from France called Cristal.

This body contouring technique allows you to find a balanced harmonious body thanks to the crystallization of the fat and elimination of these deposits.

This technology treats localized fat deposits in a non-invasive way and without anesthesia to reduce stubborn pockets of fat and fat rolls by up to 30%\!

Results are visible after 2 months and permanent after 1 to 2 sessions only.

In 95% of cases only one session is required.

What is cryolipolysis?

Cryolipolysis is referred to as fat freezing. It is a nonsurgical fat reduction procedure that uses cold temperature to reduce fat deposits in certain areas of the body. The procedure is designed to reduce localized bulges that do not respond to diet and exercise. It is not intended for people who are overweight.

What areas of the body are best suited for cryolipolysis?

Cryolipolysis has been approved to treat fat deposits beneath the chin, upper arms, inner and outer thighs, abdomen, hip/flank “love handles”, upper back, lower back, and underneath the buttocks.

How are fat cells destroyed?

The technique is based on applying cold temperatures to crystallize fat cells resulting in the death of the these cells whilst leaving the skin intact and uninjured.

Macrophages, a type of white blood cells and part of the body’s immune system will eliminate the debris from the body which will result in a more balanced physique.

There are many advantages to cryolipolysis:

* No surgical incision is required.
* It is a low risk procedure. There is no risk of infection.
* Patients do not need to be sedated or anesthetized before undergoing the procedure.
* More than one area of the body may be treated in a single session.
* Most people can resume their normal daily activities immediately after treatment.
* The procedure can be performed on people of all ages.
* There is no damage to nerve fibres, blood vessels, muscles, or lasting damaging to the skin in the treatment area.
* Fat cells that have been damaged or destroyed are permanently removed from the body.
* Patients may experience an increase in self-esteem due to an improvement in their appearance.

What side effects are to be expected immediately after cryolipolysis?

Temporary side effects for the areas that are treated may include:

* Pain or aches
* Stinging or tingling of the skin
* Redness
* Swelling
* Skin discolouration or bruising
* Skin sensitivity or numbness

Side effects may persist for a few days to a few weeks after treatment. Your doctor may recommend that you take an analgesic medication to relieve pain or other discomfort.
