**Topical Vitamin C**

Did you know that Vitamin C plays an essential role in your body’s ability to make collagen? It is also a powerful anti-oxidant that protects cells from free radical damage caused by sun and pollution. Adding Vitamin C to your daily skin care regime will help reduce the appearance of fine lines & wrinkles and will also brighten and even out skin tone. Vitamin C Serum Benefits:

* reduces wrinkles
* protects collagen and increases production
* aids wound healing

* reduces hyperpigmentation
* evens skin tone
* brightens complexion
* acts like armour against pollution and other free radicalsThe best time to apply Vitamin C is in the morning, on a clean face before applying sunscreen

**TIPS&nbsp;**

When choosing a vitamin C make sure to look for L-ascorbic acid on the ingredient list.&nbsp;

L-ascorbic acid is the only bioavailable form of vitamin C - meaning it is the only form of Vit. C that will have an active effect on the skin.

Look for Ferulic acid and vitamin E in the ingredients list. These two help stabilize the vitamin C and help to reduce oxidation of the product.

Any vitamin C product should be in a dark bottle to slow down oxidation caused by UV.&nbsp;

Always keep your bottle closed\!

Look for airless pumps because these types of bottles slow down oxidation caused by UV.

Look for serums only when shopping for Vitamin C. Other delivery methods such as creams, lotions or moisturizers are not as concentrated as a serum and have reduced absorption.&nbsp;

With an effective skin care regimen and a bit of perseverance, your skin can appear fresher and younger looking.
