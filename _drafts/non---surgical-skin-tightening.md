Non - Surgical Skin Tightening

**Here at the Body Lab we address ageing skin and laxity with the assistance of our 3DEEP Endymed machine (A favourite of Kim Kardashian’s\!\!) As well as with the Accent Prime, the newest machine from Alma. Two very powerful platforms with strong RF technology to contour and tighten the body and face.**

Thanks to the advancement of technology skin tightening procedures have been made possible without having to undergo painful surgical treatments that require down-time.

Radio-frequency (RF) is a treatment that has become increasingly popular in recent years and uses RF energy to heat the dermis and tighten the skin without damaging the top layer.

The goal is to induce thermal damage in order to stimulate neocollagenesis in deep layers of the skin and subcutaneous tissue

The energy from the heat delivered to the existing collagen causes it to shrink, which immediately alters the appearance of skin, while also triggering the production of new collagen and elastin. This collagen remodelling helps to make the skin look younger and firmer, tightening loose or lax skin and improving tone and texture

Radio-frequency treatment is suitable for targeting loose skin around the neck and chin as well as wrinkles and lines that develop between the nose and mouth and anywhere else on the body.Your average radio-frequency treatment takes anywhere between 20 and 45 minutes and there’s very little downtime - you’re likely to experience a bit of redness for up to 24 hours afterwards but that’s about it. During the treatment a machine will heat skin to a bearable 38-40 degrees.

Your skin temperature should be measured during the treatment to ensure that it’s high enough to bring about significant benefits without risking problems such as burns.

The beauty of radio-frequency is that it is suitable for most people - the depth of heating helps to firm, tighten and lift as well as reinvigorating skin for a healthy glow.

All energy based bio-stimulative treatments naturally require a course of several sessions (from five to twelve) and will induce benefits gradually over some months. Look at it as similar to&nbsp; joining a skin gym - great results are not achieved in one singular session.

Key benefits of EndyMed<sup>&trade;</sup> can include:

* A non-invasive procedure.
* No damage to surrounding tissues.
* Little to no discomfort during or after treatment.
* Minimal to no downtime.
* Continued growth of new collagen for prolonged results.
* Moderate contouring to the targeted area(s)
