  Pressotherapy is a very popular and completely painless technique used in
  medicine and aesthetic cosmetics to fight swelling and cellulite. It helps
  your body to get rid of toxins in a very natural way. The lymphatic system is
  stimulated by alternating compression and decompression cycles of the
  Pressotherapy equipment. Thus, it improves blood and lymphatic flow and
  increases extra fluid cleansing.
