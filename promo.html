    description_html: >-
      <h3>non-surgical permanent fat removal</h3><h2>50% OFF for 3-4
      cups</h2><p>Fat freezing is a non-invasive alternative to liposuction.
      Through the controlled application of cooling cups with temperature
      ranging from +5 to -11 &deg;C, the procedure reduces fat cell volume by up
      to 30%</p><p>By the end of the freezing treatment, the targeted fat cells
      gradually die off and are expelled through the body&rsquo;s natural
      elimination process. For this reason, the end result can be seen up to
      three months later. Fat Freezing sessions can be done only once per month.
      This treatment is recommended in conjunction with
      Pressotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduction
      of fat tissue</li><li>Body shaping and contouring</li><li>Skin tightening
      and toning</li><li>Cellulite reduction</li></ul>

    description_html: >-
      <h3>HARD CELLULITE REDUCTION</h3><h2><strong>20%
      OFF</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Super Cellulite Reduction is a signature
      treatment that combines powerful ultrasound fat cavitation and vacuum
      roller actin cellulite massage .</p><p>Ultrasound cavitation is often
      billed as a liposuction alternative. It&rsquo;s another type of
      noninvasive body contouring method to reduce the appearance of fat on the
      body.</p><p>In this method, ultrasonic waves transform your fat cells into
      fatty acids. Your body can then dispose of those fatty acids &mdash; they
      won&rsquo;t stick around as fat cells do.</p><p>However, ultrasound
      cavitation isn&rsquo;t technically a &ldquo;fat loss&rdquo; procedure.
      Liposuction targets fat more specifically. With ultrasound fat cavitation,
      you&rsquo;ll instead measure your success by how many inches you lose
      after treatment.</p><p>Mechanical vacuum massage affects fat cells,
      connective tissue, vascular and lymphatic system more efficiently than any
      other manual massage.The task of anti-cellulite massage is to fragment the
      hypodermic fatty tissue, remove toxic substances from the organism, reduce
      cellulite, improve blood circulation of the skin and muscles; it makes the
      skin more elastic.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduces and
      prevents cellulite&nbsp;</li><li>Supports weight loss</li><li>Improves
      skin elasticity&nbsp;</li><li>Tones and tightens
      skin&nbsp;</li><li>Stimulates blood and lymphatic flow</li><li>Eliminates
      toxins&nbsp;</li></ul>

      into a flow toward the targeted cells and tissue, which helps to reduce
      the impact on the outer layers of the dermis. Through this process,
      Endymed stimulates collagen regeneration which helps to increase strength,
      structure and elasticity in your skin, resulting in firmer, more contoured
      skin overall</p><p>Endymed is our absolute favorite for Skin Tightening
