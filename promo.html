    description_html: >-
      <h3>non-surgical permanent fat removal</h3><h2>50% OFF for 3-4
      cups</h2><p>Fat freezing is a non-invasive alternative to liposuction.
      Through the controlled application of cooling cups with temperature
      ranging from +5 to -11 &deg;C, the procedure reduces fat cell volume by up
      to 30%</p><p>By the end of the freezing treatment, the targeted fat cells
      gradually die off and are expelled through the body&rsquo;s natural
      elimination process. For this reason, the end result can be seen up to
      three months later. Fat Freezing sessions can be done only once per month.
      This treatment is recommended in conjunction with
      Pressotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduction

    description_html: >-
      <h3>HARD CELLULITE REDUCTION</h3><h2><strong>20% OFF</strong></h2><p>Super
      Cellulite Reduction is a signature treatment that combines powerful
      ultrasound fat cavitation and vacuum roller actin cellulite massage
      .</p><p>Ultrasound cavitation is often billed as a liposuction
      alternative. It&rsquo;s another type of noninvasive body contouring method
      to reduce the appearance of fat on the body.</p><p>In this method,
      ultrasonic waves transform your fat cells into fatty acids. Your body can
      then dispose of those fatty acids &mdash; they won&rsquo;t stick around as
      fat cells do.</p><p>However, ultrasound cavitation isn&rsquo;t technically
      a &ldquo;fat loss&rdquo; procedure. Liposuction targets fat more
      specifically. With ultrasound fat cavitation, you&rsquo;ll instead measure
      your success by how many inches you lose after treatment.</p><p>Mechanical
      vacuum massage affects fat cells, connective tissue, vascular and
      lymphatic system more efficiently than any other manual massage.The task
      of anti-cellulite massage is to fragment the hypodermic fatty tissue,
      remove toxic substances from the organism, reduce cellulite, improve blood
      circulation of the skin and muscles; it makes the skin more
      elastic.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduces and prevents
      cellulite&nbsp;</li><li>Supports weight loss</li><li>Improves skin
      elasticity&nbsp;</li><li>Tones and tightens skin&nbsp;</li><li>Stimulates
      blood and lymphatic flow</li><li>Eliminates toxins&nbsp;</li></ul>
