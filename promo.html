      <h3>non-surgical permanent fat removal</h3><p>50% OFF</p><p>Fat freezing
      is a non-invasive alternative to liposuction. Through the controlled
      application of cooling cups with temperature ranging from +5 to -11
      &deg;C, the procedure reduces fat cell volume by up to 30%</p><p>By the
      end of the freezing treatment, the targeted fat cells gradually die off
      and are expelled through the body&rsquo;s natural elimination process. For
      this reason, the end result can be seen up to three months later. Fat
      Freezing sessions can be done only once per month. This treatment is
      recommended in conjunction with
      Pressotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduction
      of fat tissue</li><li>Body shaping and contouring</li><li>Skin tightening
      and toning</li><li>Cellulite reduction</li></ul>
