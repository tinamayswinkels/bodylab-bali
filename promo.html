      <h3>non-surgical permanent fat removal</h3><h2>50% OFF</h2><p>Fat freezing
      is a non-invasive alternative to liposuction. Through the controlled
      application of cooling cups with temperature ranging from +5 to -11
      &deg;C, the procedure reduces fat cell volume by up to 30%</p><p>By the
      end of the freezing treatment, the targeted fat cells gradually die off
      and are expelled through the body&rsquo;s natural elimination process. For
      this reason, the end result can be seen up to three months later. Fat
      Freezing sessions can be done only once per month. This treatment is
      recommended in conjunction with
      Pressotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduction

      <h3>Deep pores cleaning, brightening,</h3><h2>15% OFF</h2><p>The Carbon
      Laser Peel is highly beneficial for people with oily skin, blackheads,
      enlarged pores, dull skin and acne on the face or body. It is also an
      excellent way to exfoliate and refresh your skin, providing an instant
      glow and leaving skin feeling softer, smoother and firmer with reduced
      fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</p><p>It works by applying a layer of liquid
      carbon to the skin, where it penetrates deeply into the pores. Laser light
      is highly attracted to the carbon particles. When the laser is passed over
      the area, it destroys the carbon, taking dead skin cells, contaminants and
      oil with it.</p><p>The facial has been dubbed the &ldquo;Hollywood
      Peel&rdquo; because there are several A-list fans of the treatment &ndash;
      including Angelina Jolie and Kim Kardashian. It&rsquo;s success is down to
      it&rsquo;s immediate positive effects without any down-time or discomfort
      and as a result it&rsquo;s now being used by many celebs just before a red
      carpet event. It&rsquo;s so effective at combatting active acne that just
      4 treatments is enough to clear even the most stubborn
      spots.</p><p><strong>PERFECT FOR</strong>:</p><ul><li>Active acne &nbsp;
      &nbsp;</li><li>Acne scars &nbsp;</li><li>Large pores &nbsp;
