Today more and more people are struggling to stay fit and healthy. Modern pace of life forces us to eat on the run. Fast food restaurants are now an integral part of our lives. You don’t have to be a nutrition specialist to realize how bad for our health and bodies is this food. The consequences can be seen at every seaside around the world. However, I’m not here to judge, but to propose a solution. And the solution is called fat freezing cryo lipo therapy .

&nbsp;

The cryo lipo therapy is a real, non-surgical alternative to liposuction. It is absolutely non-invasive procedure aimed at reducing your body fat. It is based on the fact that fat cells are less resistant to cold, than skin cells. Don’t worry! You will not be subjected to terrible sub-zero temperatures. The whole process is carried out at -7 to -10 oC, the actual value depends on the fat layer thickness. No other body structures are affected by the treatment.

&nbsp;

The duration is only 60 minutes, i.e. one active practice at a gym. Unlike the actual practice you don’t have to run, jump and sweat. Just lie on a comfortable bed and watch your fat disappear! One session helps you to reduce the fat layer by 20-30% or 3-6 cm.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The areas treated with help of the fat freezing treatments :double chin, abdomen, hips, thighs, arms and lower buttocks, i.e. the areas which are most subjected to fat accumulation.

&nbsp;

It is recommended to take 1-3 sessions to get the best out of this method. Don’t get too excited! It is allowed to take only one session every 45 days, for your own good. It takes 45 days for the dead fat cells to be completely removed out of a body through lymphatic system.

&nbsp;

Be patient and 60 days later you will be able to see the full result. Frozen cells will not come back because they would be dead, and since we are not in George Martin’s Game of Thrones world: what is dead – stays dead!<br>When a procedure is over you might observe a small reddening of the skin, don’t worry it is completely normal and it will go away in one week.

&nbsp;

If you want to speed up the result please drink water (around 2 L daily), keep to low fat and carb diet and exercise. &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

So, no reason to procrastinate! If you don’t want to miss on a great opportunity and make you body to look like the one of a Hollywood superstar in a completely safe and effortless way, remember this innovative method. Undergo ice shaping, shape you life for the better!
