description: >-
  Pressotherapy is a very popular and completely painless technique used in
  medicine and aesthetic cosmetics to fight swelling and cellulite. It helps
  your body to get rid of toxins in a very natural way. The lymphatic system is
  stimulated by alternating compression and decompression cycles of the
  Pressotherapy equipment. Thus, it improves blood and lymphatic flow and
  increases extra fluid cleansing.

Microcurrent Facial is a new clinically tested innovation designed to make your face look much younger and fresher with help of low-frequency current impulses (also called microcurrects). Micro currents significantly improve skin tone, restore water balance, remove ‘double chin’ and have other considerable aesthetic effects.

How is Microcurrent Facial performed?

During Microcurrent Facial a specialist utilizes two hand help prongs which send a certain amount of microcurrents to the predetermined zone. They imitate natural body current stimulating the muscle underneath the skin. Microcurrrents trigger natural reactions in your body at a cellular level enhancing production of collagen and elastin, providing great circulatory effect.

This treatment is performed in combination of acupuncture practices. You don’t have to worry, no needles are involved! The Microcurrent Facial procedure is considered a needleless mesotherapy, since it helps rejuvenating serum to penetrate into the deepest skin layers. We just put the prongs against the acupuncture points and sent weak impulses. The procedure is so relaxing, that some patients may even fall asleep!

What problems Microcurrent Facial help to fight?

During this procedure the facial muscles are lightly stimulated, thus they are brought in tone, which straightens the fine lines. It lifts jaws and eyebrows. It also helps to reduce swelling enhancing lymph drainage. The patients’ skin tone becomes lighter and more homogeneous due to reduction of slight pigmentation.

How long should you take the Microcurrent Facial?

Microcurrent Facial is recommended to carry out 2 to 4 times per week. The treatment course consists of 10 sessions. The duration of the procedure is 60 minutes.
