## Thermolift treatment&nbsp;

Thermolift is considered the most effective non-invasive procedure for restoring the natural skin beauty. Unlike surgical face lifting, this method is not associated with any incisions and dramatic cosmetic changes.&nbsp;

Thermolift uses high focused radio frequencies to heat different skin layers. The key factor here is collagen. The collagen is a basic component of human connective tissue and is responsible for smoothness of skin. Thermolift send energy pulses towards the skin in controlled and measures amounts. Body is tricked in the way it thinks a skin layer is damaged, and it starts to generate collagen to restore these damages. You have nothing to worry about! This procedure is harmless and you don’t feel any discomfort.

Thermolift procedure is carried out on face (significantly tightens facial contours, eliminates wrinkles and ensures solid skin structure) and body (removes cellulite manifestations and lifts sagged skin). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

The results can be seen even after the first session! In order to see the full benefit you need to undergo 5-7 sessions, once in 5 days. The result usually lasts about two years. Surgical methods offer much longstanding results (about ten years), but such invasive methods imply more expenses, longer recovery time and other relative risks. Thermolift, on the other hand, is much safer, cost efficient and quicker.

One session might take from 60 up to 120 minutes depending on the areas to be treated. It is recommended to consult your physician before and after the procedure to be completely aware of what is going on with your body.

Come and see for yourself how your whole appearance can be changed without any efforts and risks. Sit back, relax and enjoy the beauty!
