title: Best treatments for wrinkles and skin tightening ?
description: >-
  Thermolift treatment 


  Aging is an inherent process of our life and face is the first body part
  suffering from it. Weak blood flow to facial blood vessels, reduction of cell
  reproduction, stress, smoking and poor environmental conditions – all this
  leads to appearance of wrinkles and general deterioration of skin structure.
  However, modern scientists are able to fight this problem!    


  Thermolift is considered the most effective non-invasive procedure for
  restoring the natural skin beauty. Unlike surgical face lifting, this method
  is not associated with any incisions and dramatic cosmetic changes. 


  Thermolift uses high focused radio frequencies to heat different skin layers.
  The key factor here is collagen. The collagen is a basic component of human
  connective tissue and is responsible for smoothness of skin. Thermolift send
  energy pulses towards the skin in controlled and measures amounts. Body is
  tricked in the way it thinks a skin layer is damaged, and it starts to
  generate collagen to restore these damages. You have nothing to worry about!
  This procedure is harmless and you don’t feel any discomfort.


  Thermolift procedure is carried out on face (significantly tightens facial
  contours, eliminates wrinkles and ensures solid skin structure) and body
  (removes cellulite manifestations and lifts sagged skin).       


  The results can be seen even after the first session! In order to see the full
  benefit you need to undergo 5-7 sessions, once in 5 days. The result usually
  lasts about two years. Surgical methods offer much longstanding results (about
  ten years), but such invasive methods imply more expenses, longer recovery
  time and other relative risks. Thermolift, on the other hand, is much safer,
  cost efficient and quicker.


  One session might take from 60 up to 120 minutes depending on the areas to be
  treated. It is recommended to consult your physician before and after the
  procedure to be completely aware of what is going on with your body.


  Come and see for yourself how your whole appearance can be changed without any
  efforts and risks. Sit back, relax and enjoy the beauty!
