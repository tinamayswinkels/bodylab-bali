<div>In BodyLab we use 20% Fruit acid peeling by Neostrada. It is safe to be used in Bali, there will be no sun pigmentation if you use sfp 30-50 for 10 days after the treatment. The skin will not peel too much, but tissue regeneration will still go perfectly both for providing rejuvenation and for fighting the acne problem. You can make this treatment every 7-10 days to achieve the ultimate skin tone, to reduce pores and fine lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>Glycolic acid works as an exfoliant. It penetrates the skin surface, peels old dead skin cells giving a way to the newer and healthier layer. Thus the skin becomes lighter and smoother.</div>

<div>Fruit acid peeling also helps to remove fine lines and wrinkles formed with aging. This procedure maintains the younger look of the skin surface stimulating collagen and elastin production.</div>

<div>AHA can be used for treatment of acne, it dries up the excessive amount of sebum and helps to open blocked hair follicles.</div>
