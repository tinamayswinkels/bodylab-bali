#### What is Hollywood Laser Carbon Peel?

Hollywood Laser Carbon Peel is a safe and painless method which helps you to rejuvenate your skin, look younger and get rid of face blemish. It exfoliates the dead cells of epidermis very gently ensuring bactericidal effect. This technique is highly recommended for people suffering from acne, blackheads, enlarged pores and uneven skin tone.

#### How does Hollywood Carbon Peel work?

This procedure combines the effects from carbon mask and laser. Firstly, a specialist applies a carbon mask on a patientâ€™s face. This is explained by the fact that carbon can absorb oil and different contaminants. While having exfoliating properties, it also fights blackheads and dead skin cells. Once the carbon layer is evenly distributed, a laser is switched on. It destroys carbon particles together with oil, contaminants and blackheads, leaving soft and smooth skin.

Due to the fact that laser penetrates to the deeper skin layers, it contributes to stimulation of collagen production. Collagen is responsible for the look and structure of your skin. It makes your skin firmer, smoother and removes wrinkles and fine lines. After the procedure you will definitely notice that your skin has youthful appeal to it. &nbsp;

This technique is the ultimate tool resolving issues connected with acne and oily skin. The thermal effect kills the bacteria responsible for acne formation. In addition, carbon mask reduces sebum produced by sebaceous gland, the culprit of oily face. Your lipid and water skin layer will be definitely restored, if taking this procedure on a regular basis. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
