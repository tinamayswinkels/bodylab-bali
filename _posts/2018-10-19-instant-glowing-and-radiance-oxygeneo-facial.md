What is Oxygeneo Facial?

Oxygeneo Facial is a 3-in-1 super facial procedure designed to improve the condition of your face skin giving it a brand new glow and radiance. The treatment is carried out with a special hand devise. Its gentle vibration allows using it on a sensitive skin and on face areas, like around eyes, mouth, and nose. The Oxygeneo Facial treatment is carried out in 3 stages:

1. Exfoliation

The first thing you have to do is to remove a layer of dead skin cells. This makes the skin smoother, refreshes and prepares it to receive oxygen and active nutrients.

1. Infusion

At this stage the skin is infused with active ingredients like antioxidants, peptides and hyaluronic acid.

1. Oxygenation

When the skin is cleansed and infused, the device begins to produce CO2 bubbles. They penetrate the skin and trigger a natural response of the body, consisting in sending the oxygen-rich blood towards this area, increasing skin metabolism and capillary flow. Due to all this, all the nutrients from the second stage are optimally absorbed.

What are the benefits?

Among the uncontested advantages of the Oxygeneo Facial are:

* youthful radiance;

* stimulation of new cell production;

* improving of collagen production;

* reduction of wrinkles and hyperpigmentation.

Schedule of sessions

You are recommended to take this procedure once per week, if necessary. One session is approximately 60 minutes.
