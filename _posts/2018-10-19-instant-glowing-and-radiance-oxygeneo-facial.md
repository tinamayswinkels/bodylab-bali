Many popular celebrities take it to be always ready for a red carpet appearance or a perfect photo session. This procedure is a natural choice for those who want to ready for an important event or a party. Let’s look at Oxygeneo Facial and understand what makes is so great.

## What is Oxygeneo Facial?

Oxygeneo Facial is a 3-in-1 super facial procedure designed to improve the condition of your face skin giving it a brand new glow and radiance. The treatment is carried out with a special hand devise. Its gentle vibration allows using it on a sensitive skin and on face areas, like around eyes, mouth, and nose. The Oxygeneo Facial treatment is carried out in 3 stages:

1. **Exfoliation**<br><br>The first thing you have to do is to remove a layer of dead skin cells. This makes the skin smoother, refreshes and prepares it to receive oxygen and active nutrients.

2. **Infusion**<br><br>At this stage the skin is infused with active ingredients like antioxidants, peptides and hyaluronic acid.

3. **Oxygenation**<br><br>When the skin is cleansed and infused, the device begins to produce CO2 bubbles. They penetrate the skin and trigger a natural response of the body, consisting in sending the oxygen-rich blood towards this area, increasing skin metabolism and capillary flow. Due to all this, all the nutrients from the second stage are optimally absorbed.

## What are the benefits?

Among the uncontested advantages of the Oxygeneo Facial are:

* youthful radiance;
* stimulation of new cell production;
* improving of collagen production;
* reduction of wrinkles and hyperpigmentation.
