### What is Alma Accent Prime Slimming & Face Contouring?

Alma Accent Prime uses a system for ultrasound and radiofrequency modeling of the body. This provides tissue heating on two different depths. Thus essentially melting the fat cells back into place, shrinking them and smoothing them out. When the skin is heated, new collagen is stimulated resulting is smooth, youthful, tighter skin. It is a popular non-invasive way to contour the body, tighten sagging skin and minimize cellulite with minimal pain, shorter treatment times and no downtime. It is ideal for those who have problem areas despite maintaining a healthy body weight and lifestyle.

On the face, powerful RF energy applied to the face makes it possible to tighten the skin, reducing visible lines and wrinkles, tightening the facial contour, and so the skin is visibly rejuvenated. The innovative application of ultrasound waves in the face area allows for the reduction of fat deposits in the area of ​​the chin, the facial contour, the cheekbones and the nasolabial folds.

### How does Alma Accent Prime Slimming & Face Contouring work?

Accent Prime combines ultrasound and radiofrequency technologies to deliver natural, long-lasting results. Specifically, it works by:

* <div>Ultrasound</div>

Both hot and cold ultrasound are used in this treatment. Hot ultrasound thermally breaks down fat deposits while cold ultrasound disrupts fat cell membranes causing them to further breakdown and release stored fat. The released fat is then disposed of by the body through the lymphatic system.&nbsp;

* <div>Radiofrequency</div>

Radiofrequency works by accelerating the body’s ability to metabolize the released fat after the fat cells destroyed. Furthermore, radiofrequency waves penetrate the deep layers of the skin causing the skin to tighten and new collagen to be produced. The heat from the wave is strong that it will improve the thickness and alignment of collagen after the treatment and for several months thereafter as collagen continues to rebuild.

### What happens to the fat?

Accent Prime features patented Cold Ultrasound Shear technology that selectively target fat cells, while leaving surrounding tissue unharmed. The transverse wave vibrations disrupt fat cells membranes, leading to gradual breakdown release of stored fat. Damaged fat cells are then disposed of the body through the lymphatic system.

### Is Alma Accent Prime Treatment Safe?

Treatments with Accent Prime are safe and effective for all skin types (I-IV) as well as for thin and delicate areas of the face, neck and décolleté.

### Is the Treatment Painful?

Gradual heating and integrated cooling system prevent pain and a more comfortable treatment. There is no downtime. Patients may return to their normal activities post treatment.

### How many sessions needed?

Depending on the indication you want to treat, we recommend 4 – 6 sessions but mostly can be seen by the second session.
