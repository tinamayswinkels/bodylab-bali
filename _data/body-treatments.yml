    <p>Body Lab now offers fat reduction with a new machine from France called
    Cristal.<br />This body contouring technique allows you to find a balanced
    harmonious body thanks to the crystallization of the fat and elimination of
    these deposits.<br />This technology treats localized fat deposits in a
    non-invasive way and without anesthesia to reduce stubborn pockets of fat
    and fat rolls by up to 30%!<br />Results are visible after 2 months and
    permanent after 1 to 2 sessions only.<br />In 95% of cases only one session
    is required.</p><p>The technique is based on applying cold temperatures to
    crystallize fat cells resulting in the death of the these cells whilst
    leaving the skin intact and uninjured.</p><p>Macrophages, a type of white
    blood cells and part of the body&rsquo;s immune system will eliminate the
    debris from the body which will result in a more balanced
    physique.</p><p>There are many advantages to cryolipolysis:</p><ul><li>No
    surgical incision is required.</li><li>It is a low risk procedure. There is
    no risk of infection.</li><li>Patients do not need to be sedated or
    anesthetized before undergoing the procedure.</li><li>More than one area of
    the body may be treated in a single session.</li><li>Most people can resume
    their normal daily activities immediately after treatment.</li><li>The
    procedure can be performed on people of all ages.</li><li>There is no damage
    to nerve fibres, blood vessels, muscles, or lasting damaging to the skin in
    the treatment area.</li><li>Fat cells that have been damaged or destroyed
    are permanently removed from the body.</li><li>Patients may experience an
    increase in self-esteem due to an improvement in their appearance.</li></ul>

    Alma Accent Prime? ⁣Accent Prime is a system for ultrasound and radio
    frequency modeling of the body .⁣Accent Prime is the latest body shaping
    system of Alma Lasers, which ranks among the top 10 innovative systems in
    2020⁣⁣</p><p>The Accent Prime system makes it possible to treat the face and
    body, thanks to the combination of two technologies - RF waves with the
    highest safe power and ultrasonic impulses. This wave is called Shear wave
    which allows to selectively target fat cells, while leaving surrounding
    tissue unharmed. ⁣The shear wave vibrations disrupt fat cell membranes,
    leading to gradual breakdown and release of stored fat. Damaged fat cells
    are then disposed of the body through the lymphatic system. As a result of
    these processes it becomes possible to form a firmer and well-sculptured
    form of the body⁣⁣</p><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Reduce 2-6 cm per session

    <p>Super Cellulite Reduction is a signature treatment that combines powerful
    ultrasound fat cavitation and vacuum roller actin cellulite massage
    .</p><p>Ultrasound cavitation is often billed as a liposuction alternative.
    It&rsquo;s another type of noninvasive body contouring method to reduce the
    appearance of fat on the body.</p><p>In this method, ultrasonic waves
    transform your fat cells into fatty acids. Your body can then dispose of
    those fatty acids &mdash; they won&rsquo;t stick around as fat cells
    do.</p><p>However, ultrasound cavitation isn&rsquo;t technically a
    &ldquo;fat loss&rdquo; procedure. Liposuction targets fat more specifically.
    With ultrasound fat cavitation, you&rsquo;ll instead measure your success by
    how many inches you lose after treatment.</p><p>Mechanical vacuum massage
    affects fat cells, connective tissue, vascular and lymphatic system more
    efficiently than any other manual massage.The task of anti-cellulite massage
    is to fragment the hypodermic fatty tissue, remove toxic substances from the
    organism, reduce cellulite, improve blood circulation of the skin and
    muscles; it makes the skin more
    elastic.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduces and prevents
    cellulite&nbsp;</li><li>Supports weight loss</li><li>Improves skin
    elasticity&nbsp;</li><li>Tones and tightens skin&nbsp;</li><li>Stimulates
    blood and lymphatic flow</li><li>Eliminates toxins&nbsp;</li></ul>
