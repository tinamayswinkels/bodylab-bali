    <p>Fat freezing is a non-invasive alternative to liposuction. Through the
    controlled application of cooling within the temperature range of +5 to -11
    &deg;C, the procedure reduces fat cell volume by up to 30%</p><p>By the end
    of the freezing treatment, the targeted fat cells gradually die off and are
    expelled through the body&rsquo;s natural elimination process. For this
    reason, the end result can be seen up to three months later. Fat Freezing
    sessions can be done only once per month. This treatment is recommended in
    conjunction with
    Pressotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduction

    <p>3D Slimming uses unique ultrasound cavitation technology, combined with
    vacuum roller infrared function, to break down fat and smooth the skin. Once
    the fat cells are broken down, your lymphatic system picks up this waste
    material (the loose fat) and essentially flushes it from your body. The
    results are visible immediately after treatment but full elimination of
    broken fat cells can take up to seven days. This treatment is best done once
    a week in conjunction with
    Pressotherapy.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Fat

    <p>Laser hair removal will give you smoother skin and permanent hair
    reduction. The light from the laser will destroy hair follicles in a matter
    of minutes. You'll save time, money and a lifetime of shaving. Treatment can
    work on any body part you wish to remove hair from, and is especially
    effective on the bikini, lip, chin, and underarm area. For permanent hair
    reduction you need to complete 7-10 sessions spaced 6-8 weeks
    apart.&nbsp;</p><p>We ask that you shave the area you are treating
    beforehand so that the laser can penetrate deep into the root of the
    hair.&nbsp;</p><p>You should not wax, tweeze, or bleach any hair one month
    before your session because the root needs to stay in tact in order for the
    laser to be effective.</p><p>Duration: 15-120 min depending on area of
    treatment.</p>
