    <p>Fat freezing is a non-invasive alternative to liposuction. Through the
    controlled application of cooling cups with temperature ranging from +5 to
    -11 &deg;C, the procedure reduces fat cell volume by up to 30%</p><p>By the
    end of the freezing treatment, the targeted fat cells gradually die off and
    are expelled through the body&rsquo;s natural elimination process. For this
    reason, the end result can be seen up to three months later. Fat Freezing
    sessions can be done only once per month. This treatment is recommended in
    conjunction with
    Pressotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduction

    <p>Super Cellulite Reduction is a signature treatment that combines powerful
    ultrasound fat cavitation and vacuum roller actin cellulite massage
    .</p><p>Ultrasound cavitation is often billed as a liposuction alternative.
    It&rsquo;s another type of noninvasive body contouring method to reduce the
    appearance of fat on the body.</p><p>In this method, ultrasonic waves
    transform your fat cells into fatty acids. Your body can then dispose of
    those fatty acids &mdash; they won&rsquo;t stick around as fat cells
    do.</p><p>However, ultrasound cavitation isn&rsquo;t technically a
    &ldquo;fat loss&rdquo; procedure. Liposuction targets fat more specifically.
    With ultrasound fat cavitation, you&rsquo;ll instead measure your success by
    how many inches you lose after treatment.</p><p>Mechanical vacuum massage
    affects fat cells, connective tissue, vascular and lymphatic system more
    efficiently than any other manual massage.The task of anti-cellulite massage
    is to fragment the hypodermic fatty tissue, remove toxic substances from the
    organism, reduce cellulite, improve blood circulation of the skin and
    muscles; it makes the skin more
    elastic.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduces and prevents
