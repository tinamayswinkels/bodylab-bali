    <p>Profhilo is an anti-aging injectable treatment that contains hyaluronic
    acid for skin rejuvenation, hydration and elasticity. Profhilo's unique
    molecular structure stimulates the formation of 4 types of collagen, elastin
    and adipocyte (fat) stem cells which proliferate causes skin bioremodelling
    while hydrating skin from within.</p><ul><li><strong>No BDDE or chemical
    cross links</strong></li></ul><p>Profhilo contains no chemical crosslinks or
    BDDE (1,4-Butanediol Diglycidyl Ether). BBDDE has been associated with a
    slightly increased risk of inflammation and the formation of bumps in the
    skin, but BDDE in general in dermal fillers and Skinbooster is very
    safe.</p><ul><li><strong>Less inflammation and higher spreadability with
    Profhilo</strong></li></ul><p>Profhilo's patented NAHYCO&reg; technology
    binds high and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid via thermal
    cross-linking to form a Hybrid Cooperative Complex Hyaluronic Acid which
    allows for a lower inflammatory response, low viscosity, and high
    dispersibility.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Collagen and elastin bioremodelling
    in the skin with Profhilo injections</strong></li></ul><p>This hybrid
    complex of hyaluronic acid also tightens, hydrates, and rejuvenates the skin
    by initiating collagen and elastin at different skin
    depths.</p><ul><li><strong>Profhilo also contains one of the highest
    concentrations of hyaluronic acid to promote skin
    hydration.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>IS PROFHILO SAFE? </strong></p><p>So
    far, Profhilo injection treatments have been shown to be safe. Hyaluronic
    acid is safe to inject into the skin and this has been confirmed by
    research. There are several features in the Profhilo treatment that enhance
    the injection safety profile:</p><ul><li>Absence of chemical cross-linking
    or BDDE for greater biocompatibility in human skin. It also lowers the risk
    of inflammation and the formation of lumps under the skin with Profhilo
    injections.</li><li>The injection points for Profhilo are less than
    Skinbooster which means a lower risk of side effects and complications such
    as bruising and (very rarely) infection.</li><li>Profhilo injection points
    are also standardized - 5 injection points are called Bio Aesthetic Points
    (BAP)3,4,7; which is far from the main nerves and blood vessels; so the risk
    of injury to these structures is much lower.</li></ul><p><strong>WHERE ELSE
    CAN PROFHILO BE INJECTED
    TO?</strong></p><ul><li>Face</li><li>Neck</li><li>Hands</li></ul>
