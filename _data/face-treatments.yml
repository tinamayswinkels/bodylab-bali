    <p>The Carbon Laser Peel is highly beneficial for people with oily skin,
    blackheads, enlarged pores, dull skin and acne on the face or body. It is
    also an excellent way to exfoliate and refresh your skin, providing an
    instant glow and leaving skin feeling softer, smoother and firmer with fine
    lines &amp; wrinkles reduced.</p><p>It works by applying a layer of liquid
    carbon to the skin, where it penetrates deep into the pores. Laser light is
    highly attracted to the carbon particles. When the laser is passed over the
    area, it destroys the carbon, taking dead skin cells, contaminants and oil
    with it.</p><p>The facial has been dubbed the &ldquo;Hollywood Peel&rdquo;
    because there are several A-list fans of the treatment &ndash; including
    Angelina Jolie and Kim Kardashian. It&rsquo;s success is down to it&rsquo;s
    immediate positive effects without any down-time or discomfort and as a
    result it&rsquo;s now being used by many celebs just before a red carpet
    event. It&rsquo;s so effective at combatting active acne that just 4
    treatments is enough to clear even the most stubborn
    spots.</p><p><strong>PERFECT FOR</strong>:</p><p>▪ Active acne &nbsp;

    <p>Q Switched ClearLift Laser&nbsp; is an innovative treatment that takes
    years off of your face in just minutes, often referred to as the
    &lsquo;Lunchtime Facelift&rsquo; the treatment is highly controlled with no
    pain and no downtime, but still providing similar results to chemical
    peeling and laser resurfacing. The laser heats deep beneath the skin (up to
    3mm in depth), so all the skin healing happens underneath the epidermis,
    without damaging the upper layers of the epidermis at all.</p><p>It is
    becoming an increasingly popular facial rejuvenation treatment, people love
    the results of the ClearLift seeing benefits with skin tightening, reduction
    of pigment and fine lines. The laser uses a 1064nm pixel Q-Switched laser to
    create tiny ablative or treatment areas. Within these tiny areas, localised
    &lsquo;damage&rsquo; has occurred, which stimulates a healing response. As
    these areas heal, it causes the stimulation of new healthy tissue to grow,
    as well as enhancing the production of collagen and other elastin fibres.
    This helps skin to regenerate and creates a more youthful appearance,
    improves skin texture and tone, reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine
    lines, and helps with pigmentation removal.</p><p>Q switched clearlift laser
    we recommended to do once a 3 weeks and for best result repeat 3-4
    times.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Helps in the reduction of
    fine lines and wrinkles,shinks the pores.</li><li>Brightening skin,

    <p>LED therapy it is a process that emits infrared lights on your face in
    different wavelengths or spectrums. What those wavelengths are is determined
    by the specific kind of treatment you&rsquo;re looking for from LED light
    therapy.</p><p>Light therapy stimulated the skin tissue to regenerate with
    new skin cells. Light therapy also increased blood circulation, collagen
    production, and general healing of the skin. So what kind of results were
    researchers noticing? That light treatment actually helped to repair sun
    damage, reduce signs of aging, and treat rosacea.</p><p>Red light helps
    increase collagen production. And since collagen is what makes your skin
    have that young supple look, this is one of the biggest benefits. The red
    light also increases blood flow to the skin and capillaries on the face.
    This promotes healing and rejuvenation, all things you want when it comes to
    having younger-looking skin. Red light is also used to treat scarring and
    rosacea.&nbsp;</p><p>Blue&nbsp; light is able to generate a high energy form
    of oxygen that attacks the bacteria in your skin. And that bacteria is what
    causes acne. And considering the high rate of success researchers have found
    in clinical studies, blue light as an acne treatment has proven
    results!</p><p>White light Of all the lights, this is the most powerful, as
    it penetrates the deepest into your skin. White light is able to tighten
    your skin as its base layer and reduce inflammation. This gives your skin
    that smooth, healthy glow we all try so hard to achieve!</p><p>Benefits of
    LED therapy:</p><ul><li>Reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles:
    by stimulating collagen and elastin production</li><li>Reducing the
    appearance of scars and other skin ailments, such as rosacea: by deeply
    penetrating the skin and promoting growth of skin cells</li><li>Treating
    acne: by fighting off and killing the bacteria under your skin</li></ul>
