    <p>The Carbon Laser Peel is highly beneficial for people with oily skin,
    blackheads, enlarged pores, dull skin and acne on the face or body. It is
    also an excellent way to exfoliate and refresh your skin, providing an
    instant glow and leaving skin feeling softer, smoother and firmer with fine
    lines &amp; wrinkles reduced.</p><p>It works by applying a layer of liquid
    carbon to the skin, where it penetrates deep into the pores. Laser light is
    highly attracted to the carbon particles. When the laser is passed over the
    area, it destroys the carbon, taking dead skin cells, contaminants and oil
    with it.</p><p>The facial has been dubbed the &ldquo;Hollywood Peel&rdquo;
    because there are several A-list fans of the treatment &ndash; including
    Angelina Jolie and Kim Kardashian. It&rsquo;s success is down to it&rsquo;s
    immediate positive effects without any down-time or discomfort and as a
    result it&rsquo;s now being used by many celebs just before a red carpet
    event. It&rsquo;s so effective at combatting active acne that just 4
    treatments is enough to clear even the most stubborn
    spots.</p><p><strong>PERFECT FOR</strong>:</p><p>▪ Active acne &nbsp;
    &nbsp;▪ Acne scars</p><p>▪ Large pores &nbsp; &nbsp;▪ Melasma and
    pigmentation</p><p>▪ Age spots. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ▪

    <p>Q Switched ClearLift Laser&nbsp; is an innovative treatment that takes
    years off of your face in just minutes, often referred to as the
    &lsquo;Lunchtime Facelift&rsquo; the treatment is highly controlled with no
    pain and no downtime, but still providing similar results to chemical
    peeling and laser resurfacing. The laser heats deep beneath the skin (up to
    3mm in depth), so all the skin healing happens underneath the epidermis,
    without damaging the upper layers of the epidermis at all.</p><p>It is
    becoming an increasingly popular facial rejuvenation treatment, people love
    the results of the ClearLift seeing benefits with skin tightening, reduction
    of pigment and fine lines. The laser uses a 1064nm pixel Q-Switched laser to
    create tiny ablative or treatment areas. Within these tiny areas, localised
    &lsquo;damage&rsquo; has occurred, which stimulates a healing response. As
    these areas heal, it causes the stimulation of new healthy tissue to grow,
    as well as enhancing the production of collagen and other elastin fibres.
    This helps skin to regenerate and creates a more youthful appearance,
    improves skin texture and tone, reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine
    lines, and helps with pigmentation removal.</p><p>Q switched clearlift laser
    we recommended to do once a 3 weeks and for best result repeat 3-4
    times.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong></p><ul><li>Helps in the reduction of
    fine lines and wrinkles,shinks the pores.</li><li>Brightening skin,
    reduction of melasma and other pigment lesions.</li><li>Helps to lift and
    tighten the skin.</li><li>Gentle exfoliation,
