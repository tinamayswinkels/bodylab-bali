  description_html: >-
    <p>Body Lab Bali is proud to introduce you to our latest NON-SURGICAL
    Face-Lift treatment: Liftera HiFU!</p><p>This procedure is highly effective
    thanks to the unique accurate and stable heat delivery system called Thermal
    Diffusion Treatment (TDTTM). This system works at SMAS level, meaning 3 -
    4.5 mm below the skin surface, where the facial muscles are connected to the
    upper layer of the skin, which is also the layer that plastic surgeons
    manually pulls during a face.</p><p>Liftera HiFU uses ultrasound energy
    which causes the tissue at the SMAS layer to heat up rapidly. Once the cells
    in the targeted area reach a certain temperature, they experience cellular
    damage which stimulates these cells to produce even more collagen and
    elastin.</p><p>This fresh production of new collagen and elastin helps
    improve the texture of your skin, making it firmer, tighter and stronger as
    well as giving the face a natural lifting, youthful effect, diminishing
    expression lines and wrinkles.</p><p>HIFU LIFTERA has two different
    applicators (Pen &amp; Line), which allows the treatment to target different
    areas of the face more effectively and comprehensively without relying on
    surgery, and its well-known potential complications and risks. ⠀</p><p>One
    of our favorite things about Liftera is that doesn't involve down time, and
    make-up can be re-applied right after. It is very safe without causing any
    irritation, side effect or damage to the skin, being this treatment fully
    approved by the FDA.</p><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Deep Lifting
    effect</li><li>Skin
    tightening</li><li>Contouring</li><li>Rejuvenation</li><li>Long lasting

    levels&nbsp; in the skin due to melanocyte hyperactivity. This is a sign of
    photo-aging due to excessive sun exposure.⁣</p><p>⁣Melasma and/or chloasma

    cleaned and degreased, after which a peeling mask is applied for the
    recommended period of time suggested by your trained aesthetician. The
    product will be applied as a thicker layer in the areas where dark-spots are
    located.⁣</p><p>At the end of the treatment the peeling mask will be removed
    with a compress and a moisturizer, a day cream and an SPF will be
    applied.⁣</p><p>⁣The top-quality ingredients have a deep clarifying &amp;
    anti-inflammatory effect and are designed to potentiate each, penetrating
    the skin optimally to reach the right depth and reduce
    hyper-pigmentation.⁣</p><p>⁣Benefits:⁣</p><p>-Excellent results in 95% of
    hyperpigmentation cases⁣</p><p>-Safe for all skin types and acne prone
    skin⁣</p><p>-Suitable for all pigmentation including melasma, PIH (Post
    Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation) and sun damage.⁣</p><p>⁣</p><p>The skin may
    become red and flaky post-treatment. The skin shedding process normally
    begins about 48 hours after application and will last for 3-4 days. During
    this time you will apply a 50+ SPF lotion to protect your skin.⁣</p>

    <p>Solar lentigo, or as more commonly known, age spots, sun spots or liver
    spots are blemishes on the skin associated with age and exposure to UV
    radiation from the sun. They range in color from light brown to black and

    technology helps in safe and quick removal of those spots. ⁣⁣⁣⁣</p><p>How Do
    Pigmented Lesions Form?</p><p>⁣⁣Pigmented lesions, or age spots are caused
    by an increased number of pigment-producing cells (Melanocyte) in the skin.
    They occur in response to long-term sun (UV radiation) exposure and
    associated with aging of the skin. The skin tends to get thinner with age.
    This causes older people to have pale, translucent skin. Melanocytes
    activity tends to increase and more melanin is produced. Chronic sun damage
    speeds up the development of these spots.⁣⁣⁣⁣</p><p>The melanocytes absorb
    the energy of the light pulse. This light energy turns into heat energy that
    coagulates the melanocytes selectively. New cells are later formed without
    this high concentration of melanin and the skin is renewed.
