It&rsquo;s success is down to it&rsquo;s immediate positive effects without any down-time or discomfort and as a result it&rsquo;s now being used by many celebs just before a red carpet event.

      <p> <p>Q Switched ClearLift Laser&nbsp; is an innovative treatment that takes years off of your face in just minutes, often referred to as the &lsquo;Lunchtime Facelift&rsquo; the treatment is highly controlled with no pain and no downtime, but still providing similar results to chemical peeling and laser resurfacing. The laser heats deep beneath the skin (up to 3mm in depth), so all the skin healing happens underneath the epidermis, without damaging the upper layers of the epidermis at all.</p><p>It is becoming an increasingly popular facial rejuvenation treatment, people love the results of the ClearLift seeing benefits with skin tightening, reduction of pigment and fine lines. The laser uses a 1064nm pixel Q-Switched laser to create tiny ablative or treatment areas. Within these tiny areas, localised &lsquo;damage&rsquo; has occurred, which stimulates a healing response. As these areas heal, it causes the stimulation of new healthy tissue to grow, as well as enhancing the production of collagen and other elastin fibres. This helps skin to regenerate and creates a more youthful appearance, improves skin texture and tone, reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and helps with pigmentation removal.</p><p>Q switched clearlift laser we recommended to do once a 3 weeks and for best result repeat 3-4 times.</p><p>Benefits:</p><p>&bull; Helps in the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles,shinks the pores.</p><p>&bull; Brightening skin, reduction of melasma and other pigment lesions.</p><p>&bull; Helps to lift and tighten the skin .</p><p>&bull; Gentle exfoliation,rejuvenation</p><p>Duration:45min</p></p>
